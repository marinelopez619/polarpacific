                <h3>Michael Proctor</h3>
                <p>I am a business partner in Polar Pacific Properties and LMK Enterprises, LLC. I have been a real estate investor since June 2015. I reside in Southern California and have two grown children, and two grandchildren. I began my
                    working career
                    at age 11. I worked in my grandfather's cabinet shop where he taught me many valuable lessons and a good work ethic. I continued working for him through high school, while also working in retail sales. I learned the importance of
                    good
                    customer service, effective communication and interpersonal skills. After high school, I moved on to the printing business, where quality and timeliness were keys to success.
                    Looking for a new challenge, and a better quality of life, I began working with my father in his construction company. I started from the bottom and worked up to a supervisor position in a few short years. We built and remodelled
                    houses,
                    worked on commercial projects and completed state contracts for Cal Trans. I then obtained my own contractor's license and started my own company. I successfully ran my company for about five years, until the needs of my growing
                    family
                    required a more consistent work schedule and benefits. I attended the Law Enforcement training academy and became a law enforcement professional.
                    For the past 27 years I have served my community with honor and good ethics, taking to heart the oath I swore. I have also maintained my General Contractor’s License and have acted as GC on our local projects. The gradual growth
                    of our
                    business will soon enable me to retire from law enforcement and work on RE investing full time. I am excited to work toward achieving our goals and pursuing our passions.
