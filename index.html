            <p>Our goal is to use Real Estate Investing as a vehicle to fund our passion for serving others.
                Our mission is to impact lives in a positive way by providing opportunities, resources, and
                tools for their success. We have flipped properties in six states and now own SFRs and
                Multi-Family properties in 2 states. We are constantly researching various demographics and
                market indicators to locate the best markets for investment. Our current efforts are focused
                on locating, vetting, and acquiring more multi-family investments, through partnerships or
                syndication. </p>

            <h3>Michael Proctor</h3>
            <p>I am a business partner in Polar Pacific Properties and LMK Enterprises, LLC. I have been
                a real estate investor since June 2015. I have been a successful business owner for about
                five years with my General Contractor's license. I stepped down only when the needs of my
                growing family required a more consistent work schedule and benefits. I entered Law Enforcement
                training academy and served as a law enforcement professional for the past 27 years with honor
                and good ethics. I am excited to work toward achieving our goals and pursuing our passions.

            <p> My skills are in grant writing, marketing & advertising, education and customer service.
                I was instrumental during the start-up of two HVAC/ Sheet Metal Fabrication companies. I also
                owned/operated a confectionary manufacturing company before deciding on a career in education.
                My education resume spans over 18 years in which I spent 10 years as a teacher at Christian
                elementary schools, 2 years in administrator, and 6 years working with special needs and At
                Risk students. I then obtained my CA Real Estate Agent license, attended Real Estate Investment
